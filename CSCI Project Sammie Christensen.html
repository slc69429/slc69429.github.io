<h1><B>Sammie's Hometown</B></h1>
<p> Hi everyone, welcome to my webpage! The focus of my project will be something very close to my heart--my hometown. I come from Peachtree City, Georgia. While this may not seem like interesting information, my town is actually very peculiar. It is one of two "golf-cart towns" in America! So what does that mean? We just drive golf-carts around? Don't a ton of beach towns do that, why is this special? Well, unlike these towns, Peachtree City was created around designated golf-cart paths. These paths wrap around the town and provide a secondary source of transportation for citizens. These paths stretch for more than 90 miles and lead to most restaurants, stores, and neighborhoods inside of the city limits. Interestingly enough, many businesses have incorporated designated golf-cart parking spaces to accommodate for those who drive golf-carts instead of cars. These parking spaces are understandably smaller than car parking spots. Peachtree City is so well adjusted to golf-carts that we even have golf-cart police! They monitor the paths and set up random stops to check for a valid learner's permit or driver's license.</p>

<h1><B>Golf-Cart Rules and Regulations</B></h1>
<p>Although golf-carts may seem harmless, they can actually be incredibly dangerous and even deadly. To make sure that golf-carts are not treated like toys, there are several laws to protect golf-cart drivers and passengers. First of all, all golf-carts must be registered with Peachtree City within 10 days of purchase. Golf-carts are required to possess horns and these horns must be used when approaching pedestrians from behind; furthermore, golf-carts are not allowed to drive on the road as long there is a golf-cart path parallel to the road. Golf-carts are not allowed on any highways but must instead use the bridges, tunnels, and authorized crossings. Another important law is that golf-carts will be treated similarly to cars. Driving a golf-cart under the influence will result in the same punishment as driving a car under the influence. With all of this being said, <I>who can drive a golf-cart?</I> Those who are 16 or older, with or without a driver's license, are allowed to drive golf-carts. 15-year-olds with a valid learners permit in their possession are also allowed to drive a golf-cart and can be accompanied by one other person who is also 15+ years old with a learners permit. Lastly, children who are 12-14 years old can drive a golf-cart with a legal guardian in the front seat. No one under 12 years old is allowed to drive a golf-cart.</p>

<h1><B>Why Golf-Carts are <I>Awesome!</I></B></h1>
<P>Growing up, I could not imagine life without golf-carts because Peachtree City was the only place I lived. Although I now know what life is like outside of a golf-cart community, I will always cherish the time that I had in Peachtree City. Golf-carts provided me with many bonding opportunities when relatives would come visit. My parents and I would always take them on golf-cart rides to restaurants, parks, and other attractions in town. Golf-carts also provided my parents with a fun way to get their young children to school. My parents would always take my sisters and I to school on the golf-cart instead of the car which made us excited to leave the house. Outside of my childhood, golf-carts provided me with a sense of freedom when I was a teenager. Starting at the age of 15, I could drive to my friend's house, get food, and drive to school, all without having my parents tag along. It was like having the freedom of a car before I got my driver's license. Although there are many great things about the place that I grew up, golf-carts might just be the best thing to come out of Peachtree City. Below I am attaching a link so that you can experience where I come from!</p>
